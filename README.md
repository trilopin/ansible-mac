# Mac Development Ansible Playbook

Original https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook.svg?branch=master

Preparation
```
xcode-select --install
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install ansible
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```


### Running a specific set of tagged tasks

You can filter which part of the provisioning process to run by specifying a set of tags using `ansible-playbook`'s `--tags` flag. The tags available are `dotfiles`, `homebrew`, `mas`, `extra-packages` and `osx`.

    ansible-playbook main.yml -i inventory -K --tags "dotfiles,homebrew"


## Issues
* mackup only has sense if you have dotfiles previously there
* Dock setup automation
* Still don't trust a lot in .macos file
* vscode is backed by sync extension inside a gist


## Overriding Defaults

Not everyone's development environment and preferred software configuration is the same.

You can override any of the defaults configured in `default.config.yml` by creating a `config.yml` file and setting the overrides in that file. For example, you can customize the installed packages and apps with something like:

    homebrew_installed_packages:
      - cowsay
      - git
      - go

    mas_installed_apps:
      - { id: 443987910, name: "1Password" }
      - { id: 498486288, name: "Quick Resizer" }
      - { id: 557168941, name: "Tweetbot" }
      - { id: 497799835, name: "Xcode" }

    composer_packages:
      - name: hirak/prestissimo
      - name: drush/drush
        version: '^8.1'

    gem_packages:
      - name: bundler
        state: latest

    npm_packages:
      - name: webpack

    pip_packages:
      - name: mkdocs

Any variable can be overridden in `config.yml`; see the supporting roles' documentation for a complete list of available variables.





## Testing the Playbook

Many people have asked me if I often wipe my entire workstation and start from scratch just to test changes to the playbook. Nope! Instead, I posted instructions for how I build a [Mac OS X VirtualBox VM](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-osx-virtualbox-vm), on which I can continually run and re-run this playbook to test changes and make sure things work correctly.

Additionally, this project is [continuously tested on Travis CI's macOS infrastructure](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook).
